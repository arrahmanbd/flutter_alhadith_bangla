The Bangla Hadith App is a mobile application designed to provide a convenient platform for users to access and explore a collection of authentic Hadiths in the Bengali language.This app is a skill test by IRD Foundation.


IRD Foundation is providing Islamic apps for the benefit of Mankind, expecting rewards from Allah Subhanawa ta'ala alone and following the Madhab & Manhaz of Salaf-e-Salehin.

This repository contains the source code for the app.

## Key Features
- **Authentic Hadith Collection:** Carefully curated Hadiths sourced from well-known compilations, presented in Bengali.
- **Search and Navigation:** Intuitive search and navigation features for easy exploration.
- **Daily Hadith:** Delivering a daily Hadith to users for regular engagement.
- **Save Hadith:** Personalized user accounts for bookmarking, history tracking, and preferences.

## Database Analysis
I have analyzed their database and also created a demo database for demonstration purposes and code sharing. Here is my report.
If you are from IRD Foundation, please replace hadith.db with original database which located at "assest/database/" directory. Then build the app or check out relase version for the task. 
Thank you.
